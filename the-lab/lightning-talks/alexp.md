## Lightning Talk

* How I got annoyed with traditional server distros like Debian, espescially in a virtualized setup
* Growing interest in IaC (Infrastructure as Code), tell people just how cool it is to be able to write some code and define what you want
* Show just how easy it is to do certain things utilizing NixOS, ex: defining what programs will be running, the basics
* Reproducibility: how I can just copy around configuration files and just from that I can provision my server
* Reliability: once I broke a Debian update a distro with a reputation for top stability, but with NixOS you can just rollback upgrades, and partial upgrades are impossible
* Immutability: Talk about how improper config changes are hard to make, NixOS makes it harder to mess up your configuration, and you can even roll that back. Mention how small changes piled up to the "state" of a system eventually results in instability.
* Fun factor: Its just fun to work with NixOS
